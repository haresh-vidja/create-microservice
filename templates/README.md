This directory ships example templates that teams can copy to their local override path (`~/.create-microservice/templates`). Files inside those override directories are copied into the generated project after the scaffold is created, allowing complete customization with minimal effort.

Available sample templates:

- `express/` — Example Express server override.
- `fastify/` — Example Fastify server override.
- `aws/` — Sample snippets for infrastructure files.
- `cicd/` — Sample pipeline overrides.

To use a template, copy the desired folder to `~/.create-microservice/templates/<framework-or-scope>` and adjust it to match your standards.
